Freelance Web Dev with an interest in Firebase and Next.js. Learned everything from FreeCodeCamp, Roadmap.sh and FullStackOpen. 

Most of my projects work with front end until recently where I started to mix in Databases and the like. I hope to make a whole system of useful web apps on my VPS like eventually a chess puzzle app. That might just be for me though.

If you wanna have a chat lets do it. I also like gaming and 3d Printing too if thats in your repertoire.

Take a peak at some of my repositories and maybe drop by my forum at forum.bubanb.com and help me make an interesting community.
